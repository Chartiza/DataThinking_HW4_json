### Analisys
Prediction sender ID dased on messeges using logistic and liniar regresions.

### Result
In summary, it seems that the logistic regression model outperformed the linear regression model in terms of accuracy (although the accuracy is relatively low) for the given classification task. However, the use of MSE for both models is not conventional, as it is more appropriate for regression models. It would be beneficial to consider other evaluation metrics suitable for classification tasks, such as precision, recall, or F1-score, to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the models' performance.
